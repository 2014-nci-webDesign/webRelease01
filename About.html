            <h2>Brandon Ferguson</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Brandon, and I've been teaching English to hard-working students and professionals for more than ten years.</p>
            <p>I actually started out as a Spanish teacher in the United States, where I'm originally from. In 2004, I moved to Madrid, where I ran a small but very successful exam preparation school, and since 2010, I've been teaching one-to-one lessons here in Dublin. My focus is primarily on Cambridge exam preparation (FCE and CAE), IELTS preparation, and helping international students and foreign professionals perfect their English through personalised coaching. I have significant experience working speakers of Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Korean, Chinese, and Polish.<p>
            <p>The reason I became an English teacher is because I enjoy helping people expand their vocabulary, improve their pronunciation, correct errors, and sharpen their writing skills. Overall, my goal is to help you become more fluent and more confident speaking English.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.google.es/" target="_blank">Iâ€™d love to help you, so please get in touch today and we can arrange a time for a chat!</a></p>

<p>"Brandon was my teacher last year when I decided to take the FCE in Dublin. I felt really confident the day of my exam, because I knew exactly what to expect. Brandon knows all the best ways are to teach you so that you can correct your errors. She realizes exactly where your weak points are and focuses on them so you can improve. She's dynamic, caring, hard-working and concerned about her students. Thanks to her, my English has improved a lot since I've been working with her. It's time well-spent, and she has tons of materials for you to continue working at home".
